Title:
  Drop Collections

Prerequisites:
  * Set up Mocha
  * Set up Mongo

Overview:
  We will be exploring the mongoose methods find(criteria) and findOne(criteria) in this tutorial.

  * find()- This method will find all the records that matches the criteria.
  * findOne() - This will return the first occurance of the record.

Changes made:
  * In connection.js, we will add a new beforeEach hook to drop test collection before each test case is executed in mocha.
